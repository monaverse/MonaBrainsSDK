10. Once set up is complete, you should see a menu item at the top of Unity called 'Mona' with the option to launch the brains editor.

11. You may receive the following compiler errors once brains is installed. This is because the VRM and Brains Libraries use different GLTF importer libraries.

- Set your importer to the `MonaUnityGLTF` library.
